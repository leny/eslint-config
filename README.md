## About

It's been years I use ESLint. I've taylored my config for that time. I'm finally creating this to stop copy/paste it everytime.

## Usage

To use these rules, you simply need to configure your `.eslintrc.js` to look like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
	extends: "@leny"
};
```

> cf. the official ESLint documentation [page about shareable configs](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs#using-a-shareable-config).
